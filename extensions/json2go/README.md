# JSON to Go Struct Converter

This tool converts JSON data into Golang struct format. It helps you generate Go struct definitions based on the provided JSON input.


## Example

Let's say you have the following JSON data:

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```

Running the converter with this JSON input will generate the following Go struct:

```go
type Person struct {
    Name  string `json:"name"`
    Age   int    `json:"age"`
    Email string `json:"email"`
}
```
